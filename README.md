## youtrack
- Do you hate the visual mess that is the web version of youtrack?
- Do you wish it was easier to create a tech debt issue right from the line of code you're reading?
- Did a previous dev make the whole product org use Youtrack because he used Intellij?

If so, this is the plugin for you
